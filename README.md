## Welcome
Welcome to the *good soup* a.k.a my personal notes repository, where I'll be keeping track of anything hacking related.

## Small index
This index will be up to date for approximately 2 weeks after it was committed.
- [Active Directory](AD/AD.md)
- [DNS](DNS/tools.md)
- [msfvenom](Payloads/msfvenom.md)
- [staging payloads](Payloads/staging.md)
- [Active Directory](AD/AD.md)
- [Ports](Ports/Ports.md) -> Not going to be another complete overview as there is plenty of them out there. Maybe I'll just treat it as *random notes to each port I don't know where else I should put it*
- [Windows Privilege Escalation](good%20soup/notes/privesc/Windows/index.md)
